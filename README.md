This repo will show me progressing through learning parsing and interrupting expressions, in C#.

I started with a bracket parsing project, and I plan to be able to eventually solve any equation (that can be simplified into a quadratic equation). 

I hope you'll find my learning process intresting.

##What I've done so far

1. Parsed parens of the sort ((5)((3)(2))) 

2. Parsed and calculated math expressions like `5 - 3 * 2` (with order of operations) 

3. Parsed and calculated math expressions like `(5 + 2) * 3` (including parens) 

4. Parsed equations like `2x + 5 = 4`

5. Simplfied equations

6. Solved equations (up to quadratic)
