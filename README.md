This repo will show me progressing through learning parsing and interrupting expressions, in C#.

I started with a bracket parsing project, and I plan to progress untill I can eventually parse and calculated mathematical expressions like `3 + 5 * 9`.

I hope you'll find my learning process intresting.

~~~What I've done so far~~~

1. Parsed parens\brackets of the sort ((5)((3)(2))) 

~~~What I plan to so~~~

1. Be able to parse and calculate math expressions like `5 - 3 * 2` (with order of operations) 

2. be able to parse and calculate math expression like `(5 + 2) * 3` (including parens) 

3. Be able to parse equations like `2x + 5 = 4`

    1. Be able to simplfy equations

    2. Be able to solve equations (only up to quadratic)
